# Data Analytics Portfolio 

## About

Hi, I'm Isna! A recent graduate with degree in statistics. Througout my academic journey, I develop a strong passion for data analytics and its applications in several domains. During my time as a statistics student, I embarked on an exciting journey exploring the depths of data analytics. I was introduced to a wide array of statistical concepts and data analytics technique that laid the foundation for my analytical skills.

This repository serves to showcase my skills and as a platform to share my projects, and a way to track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science-related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Cluster Analysis of East Asian Tourism Destination Reviews on TripAdvisor
**Code:** [`Cluster_Analysis_TripAdvisor.ipynb`]([https://github.com/nktnlx/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/main/video_games_sales.ipynb](https://github.com/rahayuisna23/data_analytics_portofolio/blob/60f40af89815bb2c74557d718bdea7caeb8ce16b/Cluster_Analysis_of_East_Asian_Tourism_Destination_Reviews_on_TripAdvisor.ipynb))    
**Description:** Data sourced from TripAdvisor.com contains reviews of destinations in 10 mentioned categories across East Asia. Each traveler rating is mapped as Very Good (4), Very Good (3), Average (2), Bad (1), and Very Bad (0) and the average rating is used for each category per User. The purpose of the analysis is to group users based on their reviews in various destination categories, so a clustering analysis is carried out using the KMeans and K-Medoids methods on the data so that these two methods are used to compare which clustering results are better.  
**Skills:** Data Processing, Data Analysis, Clustering Techniques, Data Visualization.  
**Technology:** Python, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, pandas, scipy.stats, seaborn.  
**Results:** Based on the clustering analysis that has been done, it is found that the best clustering method used for this dataset is the K-Means Cluster method because it has a higher silhouette value than the K-Medoids method and 2 clusters will be formed because the user has been clustered according to the rating given to the several destinations, the results of this clustering can be used as recommendations to determine suitable destinations for each user to visit so that users can prepare trips to be more effective.
