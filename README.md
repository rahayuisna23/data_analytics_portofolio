# Data Analytics Portfolio 

## About

Hi, I'm Rahayu! A recent graduate with degree in statistics. Througout my academic journey, I develop a strong passion for data analytics and its applications in several domains. During my time as a statistics student, I embarked on an exciting journey exploring the depths of data analytics. I was introduced to a wide array of statistical concepts and data analytics technique that laid the foundation for my analytical skills. This repository serves to showcase my skills and as a platform to share my projects, and a way to track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science-related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Cluster Analysis of East Asian Tourism Destination on TripAdvisor
**Code:** [`Cluster_Analysis_of_East_Asian_Tourism_Destination_on_TripAdvisor.ipynb`](https://github.com/rahayuisna23/data_analytics_portofolio/blob/230298a56ef5cfdaabf0a790c8cfce440cbd12b7/Cluster_Analysis_of_East_Asian_Tourism_Destination_on_TripAdvisor.ipynb)    
**Description:** Data sourced from TripAdvisor.com contains reviews of destinations in 10 mentioned categories across East Asia. Each traveler rating is mapped as Very Good (4), Very Good (3), Average (2), Bad (1), and Very Bad (0) and the average rating is used for each category per User. The purpose of the analysis is to group users based on their reviews in various destination categories, so a clustering analysis is carried out using the KMeans and K-Medoids methods on the data so that these two methods are used to compare which clustering results are better.  
**Skills:** Data Processing, Data Analysis, Clustering Techniques, Data Visualization.  
**Technology:** Python, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, pandas, scipy.stats, seaborn.  
**Results:** Based on the clustering analysis it is found that the best clustering method used for this dataset is the K-Means Cluster method because it has a higher silhouette value than the K-Medoids method and 2 clusters will be formed because the user has been clustered according to the rating given to the several destinations, the results of this clustering can be used as recommendations to determine suitable destinations for each user to visit so that users can prepare trips to be more effective. 

### Forecasting the Percentage of Poverty in Purworejo Regency
**Code:** [`Forecasting the Percentage of Poverty in Purworejo Regency.xlsx`](https://github.com/rahayuisna23/data_analytics_portofolio/blob/230298a56ef5cfdaabf0a790c8cfce440cbd12b7/Forecasting%20the%20Percentage%20of%20Poverty%20in%20Purworejo%20Regency.xlsx)       
**Description:** Forecasting the percentage of poverty in Purworejo Regency in 2022 uses three different methods: Moving Average (MA), Double Exponential Smoothing with Holt Two Parameters, and Double Exponential Smoothing with One-Parameter Brown. Evaluation of this forecasting method uses the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), which measures the amount of error generated by each forecasting method. The forecasting method with the smallest RMSE appears as the optimal choice for predicting the percentage of poverty.   
**Skills:** Data Visualization, Data Analysis, Forecasting.    
**Technology:** Microsoft Excel.     
**Results:** From the results of the analysis carried out, it was found that the forecasting method with the smallest RMSE value is the Double Exponential Smooting Two Parameter Holt method, so that this method is used as a forecast model for the Percentage of Poor Population in Purworejo Regency in 2022. Forecast of the Percentage of Poor Population in Purworejo Regency for 2022 is 11, 9782 percent. Forecasts for the Percentage of Poor People in Purworejo Regency in 2022 show a decrease in the Percentage of Poor People compared to 2021.  

### Statistical Analysis on Factors Influencing Life Expectancy
**Code:** [`Statistical_Analysis_on_Factors_Influencing_Life_Expectancy.ipynb`](https://github.com/rahayuisna23/data_analytics_portofolio/blob/230298a56ef5cfdaabf0a790c8cfce440cbd12b7/Statistical_Analysis_on_Factors_Influencing_Life_Expectancy.ipynb)      
**Description:** This project focuses on selecting the optimal method for predicting life expectancy figures across 193 countries globally. Leveraging data from 22 variables encompassing health, economic, and social factors, the analysis employs regression analysis. The two methods employed are Decision Tree and Random Forest.The project's aim is to provide valuable insights to relevant governmental bodies, enabling advancements in the health and social sectors. By identifying influential variables and employing robust prediction methods, the analysis contributes towards fostering prosperous and well-being-oriented societies.     
**Skills:** Data Processing, Data Analysis, Regression Techniques, Data Visualization.      
**Technology:** Python, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, pandas, shap, sklearn.   
**Results:** result Based on the regression analysis it is found that the random forest model is the best model for predicting life expectancy because it has smaller MSE and MAE values. 

### Web Scraping for Self Development Book List from Grobmart Website
**Code:** [`Web Scraping for Self-Development Book List from Grobmart Website.txt`](https://github.com/rahayuisna23/data_analytics_portofolio/blob/230298a56ef5cfdaabf0a790c8cfce440cbd12b7/Web%20Scraping%20for%20Self-Development%20Book%20List%20from%20Grobmart%20Website.txt)    
**Description:** This project involves web scraping Grobmart's website to create a table listing discounted self-development books. The table comprises book titles, original and discounted prices, discount percentage, and links to book descriptions. By automating the data collection process and presenting it in a structured table, the project demonstrates proficiency in web scraping techniques and data organization. The resulting table provides users with a comprehensive overview of discounted self-development books available on Grobmart, contributing to informed reading choices and efficient shopping decisions.    
**Skills:** web scraping, data processing.    
**Technology:** R programming, rvest, dplyr, Microsoft Excel.     
**Results:** [`discounted_self_development_book.xlsx`](https://github.com/rahayuisna23/data_analytics_portofolio/blob/230298a56ef5cfdaabf0a790c8cfce440cbd12b7/discounted_self_development_book.xlsx)
