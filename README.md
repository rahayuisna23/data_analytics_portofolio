# Data Analytics Portfolio 

## About

Hi, I'm Isna! A recent graduate with degree in statistics. Througout my academic journey, I develop a strong passion for data analytics and its applications in several domains. During my time as a statistics student, I embarked on an exciting journey exploring the depths of data analytics. I was introduced to a wide array of statistical concepts and data analytics technique that laid the foundation for my analytical skills. This repository serves to showcase my skills and as a platform to share my projects, and a way to track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science-related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Video Games Sales Analysis
**Code:** [`video_games_sales.ipynb`](https://github.com/nktnlx/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/main/video_games_sales.ipynb)    
**Description:** The dataset contains 16715 records as of 2016. There is a list of video games with sales (by region), year of release, platform, critics and users score. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, filling missing values, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing region based user profiles, measuring statistical factors, hypothesis testing.  
**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, central limit theorem, hypothesis testing, data visualization.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib.  
**Results:** Review of the global and regional video games markets, data-based business recommendations.  

### A Mobile Game Data Analysis
**Code:** [`final_project.ipynb`](https://github.com/nktnlx/data_analysis_course/blob/main/37_final_project/final_project.ipynb)    
**Presentation:** [`my_project_slides.pdf`](https://github.com/nktnlx/data_analysis_course/blob/main/37_final_project/my_project_slides.pdf)   
**Description:** The final project for 5 month Data Analysis Course. Setup: you're employed in a mobile games development company. A Product Manager gives you following tasks: to find and visualize retention, to make a decision based on the A/B test data, to suggest a number of metrics to evaluate the results of the last monthly campaign.   
**Skills:** data cleaning, detecting data anomalies, python coding, data visualization, descriptive statistics, dealing with outliers, A/B tests, Shapiro–Wilk test, Levene's test, data transforms, Mann–Whitney U test, proportions z-test, bootstrapping, defining metrics.    
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels Stats, Bootstrap.     
**Results:** python functions to calculate and plot users retention, hypothesis testing, detecting statistically significant result with a recommendation to push tested in-app changes into production, a set of metrics to evaluate success of promotion campaign.  

### A Landing Page Design Experiment
**Code:** [`notebook.ipynb`](https://github.com/nktnlx/side_projects/blob/master/4_career_factory/notebook.ipynb)    
**Presentation:** [`slides.pdf`](https://github.com/nktnlx/side_projects/blob/master/4_career_factory/slides.pdf)    
**Description:** My solution to an open Data Analyst competition held by [Карьерный Цех](https://careerfactory.ru/). The solution took the 7th place in the competition (≈100 solutions were submitted by participants).     
**Skills:** evaluating A/B-test design, data cleaning, data anomalies detection, checking splitting system, calculating conversion rate, calculating bounce rate, log-scale transformations, Shapiro–Wilk test of distribution normality, A/B-tests (proportions z-test, Mann–Whitney rank test), plotting results, making conclusion and giving recommendations for follow-up actions.      
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels Stats.   
**Results:** A/B test design analysis, conclusion on rolling the new landing page design to production, recommendations on how to improve. 

### Online Advertising Campaign Analysis
**Code:** [`ya_ad_int_solution.ipynb `](https://github.com/nktnlx/side_projects/blob/master/6_ya_ad_internship/ya_ad_int_solution.ipynb)    
**Presentation:** [`ya_ad_int_slides_upd.pdf`](https://github.com/nktnlx/side_projects/blob/master/6_ya_ad_internship/ya_ad_int_slides_upd.pdf)    
**Description:** My submission to Yandex Advertising Analytics internship program.    
**Skills:** data cleaning, CTR, CPC, CPA and CR calculation, comparing metrics with competitors, visualizing results, drawing conclusions.    
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.     
**Results:** the slide deck with online advertising campaign analysis and recommendations on how to improve based on the service category.
